										<h2>Think & Research- IEEE PES ADGITM</h2>
									</header>
									<p>IEEE ADGITM organized a workshop called ‘Think and Research’ on 18th March 2019 at ADGITM’s auditorium. It was attended by students from different colleges, branches and years. The session was lead by Mr. Apoorv Arora and Mr. Aakash Bansal with a very informal casual discussion on “What exactly does research mean?” They explained the students how to think on a project and how to use resources judiciously. Further, they explained the students how they started their approach in this field. In their full interaction they mainly focused on the topic “idea inception” they told students some parameters, some principles on which their project must be work upon, some of them are Pareto Principle – 80/20 Rule - Result Oriented Mindset. Further the session continued with explanation on how to develop interest and aptitude, how to read and publish papers, networking and team building and also some communication techniques. They took an agenda of “the ultimate know how to research” and with this they took some basic points to discuss the importance of research and development.</p>

                    <p>The IEEE Student-Teacher and Research Engineer/Scientist - STAR Program is an endeavor taken by IEEE ADGITM to introduce high school students to careers in STEM, i.e., Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. It is a mentoring program for students as usually at this stage in their lives, students are often confused and clearly in oblivion of what quite lies ahead of them.
                        This year the STAR Program was organized at the GOVT. SARVODAYA KANYA VIDYALAYA, ROHINI on International Day of Women and Girls in Science, February 11, 2019, by the volunteers of WIE (Women in Engineering) as well as the other members of IEEE NIEC under the mentorship of Nishthaa Jain - Chairperson of WIE IEEE NIEC.
                        
                        The motto of the event was “Above all, be the captain of your ship” which signifies that every person is the ultimate controller of all the decisions and actions in their life.</p>

                    <p>The workshop was organized on account of Women’s day to teach women the self-defence techniques to feel more confident, secure and gain a sense of self-sufficiency. The workshop was taken by Suraj Sharma, Founder of Tackle Self	 Defense Foundation and his team.
                        Along with the students, faculty from different departments also took part in the workshop. The session commenced with some basic important tips and tricks to tackle common situations. Props (e.g. a plastic knife) used in the session created real life-like situations. The presence of a female trainer also marked a hint of reliance and comfort for the girls who showed up for the workshop. The trainer Suraj and his team created a safe and comfortable atmosphere during the class. The techniques he showed and taught were very basic and clear, understandable for everyone. The exercises and techniques involved the participants making it a fun and interactive session on both ends. A letter of appreciation was presented to Mr Suraj and his team at the end of the session.</p>

                      <p>IEEE NIEC (now IEEE ADGITM) successfully organized the Machine Learning workshop on 13th August,2018 in the auditorium of Dr. Akhilesh Das Gupta Institute of Technology and Management. The Machine Learning workshop was organized in collaboration with Coding Ninjas, one of the best programming institutes in Delhi. The session began with Mr. Jasneet Singh (Our CS Representative) introducing Mr. Parikh Jain. He is a product engineer and instructor at Coding ninjas and also a co- founder at booksquare.in. He is truly a ninja of Competitive Programming and Machine Learning.
                          After introduction, the stage was taken up by Mr. Parikh. He started the session with a discussion about general programming languages and then explained what Machine Learning is. He asked a few basic questions on machine learning and what does it actually mean, to which the participants answered quite interestingly.
                          Now, It was time to show some practical applications of machine learning for which the students were asked to install ANACONDA and Python so that the session would continue without any hindrance. The session was now slowly coming to an end and further he asked the participants for some queries not only regarding machine learning but also regarding other programming languages and GITHUB. 
                          With the session coming to an end he also told the students about the scope of machine learning in the coming future. Cool goodies were provided to the students who took part in the interactive session actively</p>

                      </header>
                      <p>One of the biggest celebrations of technology in the world is the celebration of the IEEE day. All the members of IEEE all over the world celebrate IEEE day to mark the great technological advancements that have been done so far and to encourage young minds to come forward with their ideas to change the world.

                          IEEE NIEC(now IEEE ADGITM) celebrated the IEEE day from October 11th to October 12th, 2018 with version 4.0 of its flagship event Technorax. Technorax was started three years ago with only a technical exhibition. This time we decided to take it up one notch by organizing a two-day event comprised of four sub-events. Day one and two both comprised of two sub-events each. This time the name of the event was Technorax V-4.0.
                          The events included were Rob war the main of all the technical exhibitions which attracted crowds from other colleges as well, Technical Exhibition where the students of our college showcased their talents, Hackathon which proved out to be a big success and our only fun event Escape Trio which consisted of four rounds Chocolate eating followed by Movie Crossword followed by extempore and lastly Pictionary.
                          At last, when all the events were completed, the prize distribution ceremony took place in the amphitheatre. All the winners were given goodies and certificates. 
                          
                          A cake cutting ceremony at makers’ space marked the end of this energy-packed event. All the volunteers had lots of fun and celebrated IEEE day with exuberance and determination</p>

                      <p>IEEE NIEC in collaboration with M2R TECHNOMATIONS organized a workshop on PCB designing. The workshop took place on 20-21st August 2018 in the seminar hall of ADGITM. It was beneficial for ECE as well as EEE department students.
  
                          The students were made aware of what PCB designing is and its applications. They were also made aware of the software they will be working on.
                          
                          Students were also given the kits that was used to make the project.
                          The workshop was successful and would surely help the students in future</p>
